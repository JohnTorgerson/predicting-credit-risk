##### Tools & Supplies:

* lending database

* Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn

### Guide to Repo Contents:

* `README.md` is the contents file you're currently viewing
* `Credit Risk Evaluator.ipynb` is the notebook running the code to evaluate the risk
* In folder, `Resources` is the following:
    1. `lending_data.csv` is the raw data file used to analyze and predict credit risk

### Observations:

* This data was preprocessed in various ways before I chose one
* Even after preprocessing different ways I still didn't know which best represented my data
* Random Forest Regression can be used on the data 'as is', or scaled, or selected, or both & it matters how it is preprocessed
* There remains a lot more to learn about the math happening behind the scenes with these regression tools
